  <div class="hero-sub">
    A closer look at the emotion-adaptive AI companion that powers the Artificial Human experience.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- WHY BUILT SECTION -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>The Origin</h2>
  <p>
    Sylvia AI began as a personal challenge — to build an assistant that doesn’t just <em>listen</em>, but truly reacts to how someone feels. 
    I grew up trying to understand the quieter emotions in people around me, and that curiosity slowly grew into a technical question:
    <strong>Can a machine sense mood and adapt its tone the way humans do?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This project is my attempt to explore that question. It became a blend of expression recognition, responsive dialogue, and personalized music generation — all guided by a simple idea: 
    technology should meet people where they are emotionally. Sylvia is my way of turning the quiet emotions I struggled to decode as a kid into something that can help others feel understood.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- HOW IT WORKS SECTION -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>How Sylvia Works</h2>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>1. Mood Detection</strong><br>
      Using real-time facial analysis via <em>face-api.js</em>, Sylvia identifies expressions such as happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, or neutrality. 
      The system chooses the dominant expression with a confidence score and lets the user confirm or retry.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Adaptive Conversation</strong><br>
      Once the mood is locked, Sylvia adjusts her conversational tone accordingly — warm, energetic, comforting, calm, or reflective — 
      creating dialogue that feels emotionally aware rather than generic.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Music Intelligence</strong><br>
      Sylvia offers four mood-driven music pathways: therapeutic transitions, nostalgic soundtracks, weather-based playlists, and custom “Be Your DJ” mixes. 
      These are powered through curated logic and playlist-generation APIs.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Frontend + Deployment</strong><br>
      The interface is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with emotion scanning rendered live through the camera stream. 
      The entire project runs on cloud deployment through Render.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- My ROLE SECTION -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>What I Engineered</h2>
  <p>
    I designed and developed the full system — from mood detection logic to Sylvia’s conversational flow and the music engine. 
    All UI elements, animations, visual styles, transitions, and page architecture were built manually without templates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every part of Sylvia — her voice, her reactivity, the experience around her — is the result of many iterations, 
    experiments, late-night debugging sessions, and a lot of coffee.
  </p>
</div>


<!--         THE IMPACT           -->


<div class="section">
  <h2>The Impact</h2>
  <p>
   In the first 100 people who used Artificial Human, something surprising happened. They didn’t treat it like a demo — they stayed, they engaged deeply, and several even returned the next day. For an early-stage prototype, seeing real users connect with it this quickly felt like the first signal that the idea had real weight.
  </p>

  <p>
    What stood out the most wasn’t the analytics spike, but the messages people sent afterwards. Users said Sylvia felt “surprisingly grounding after a long day.” Some returned to use it as a space to vent emotions they had no one else to tell. In the first 36 hours alone, the platform recorded over <strong>600 interactions</strong>, with users spending real time in conversation instead of bouncing away in seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though every session resets, the calm people found in those moments didn’t. A few users shared that Sylvia helped them feel less alone, sleep better, or simply breathe for a second in a chaotic routine.
  </p>

  <p>
    For something that started as a quiet personal curiosity, Artificial Human has already become a small emotional buffer for the community around it. This early impact is what keeps me building — not the numbers, but the fact that even a short conversation can make someone’s evening a little lighter.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is still just the beginning — a prototype people unexpectedly found comfort in. And that early human response is what I’m most proud of.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- VISION SECTION -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>The Vision Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    I plan to expand Sylvia with voice-based emotion sensing, better memory, deeper personalization, 
    and a more nuanced emotional model that can react to subtle changes in tone and facial micro-expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sylvia is still early — but she’s a step toward the kind of emotionally-aware AI I hope to build in the future.
  </p>
</div>
  <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Sylvia never stores photos, camera input, or conversation data.</strong></p>
  <p>All emotion detection runs locally on the user’s device, and chat sessions reset automatically after each use.</p>
  <p>No personal information, facial data, or messages are saved on the server, and nothing is shared with third parties.</p>
  <p>The goal is simple: offer emotional support without collecting anything in return — using the platform is fully anonymous.</p>
